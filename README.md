# Scheduling-Algorithms-Operating-System
A single menu driven C program to simulate the following CPU scheduling algorithms to find turnaround time and waiting time and also display gantt chart for the same.
CPU Scheduling Algorithm Simulation
This project is a C program that simulates various CPU scheduling algorithms to calculate turnaround time, waiting time, and display a Gantt chart. The following scheduling algorithms are implemented:

1) First-Come First-Served (FCFS)
2) Shortest Job First (SJF)
3) Round Robin Scheduling (RR)
4) Priority Scheduling (PS)
5) Shortest Remaining Time First (SRTF)
6) Longest Remaining Time First (LRTF)


Modules include:

GCC (GNU Compiler Collection) for compiling the C program.
A C development environment (e.g., Code::Blocks, Visual Studio Code, or any other of your choice).

Installation guide:

Just download main.c file and run it in any development editor you use ( prefer vscode ).

You can give input in input.txt file and program itself take input form file and you just need to run thr code.

Output is stored in output.txt file and also display in your code terminal.

Output Format
The program will generate the following output:

Turnaround time for each process.
Waiting time for each process.
Gantt chart showing the execution order of processes.
